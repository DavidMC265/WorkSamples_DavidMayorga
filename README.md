# WorkSamples_DavidMayorga
This is a repository that includes 3 project samples that I have contributed to as a UEFN verse developer 

- CookieClickerTycoon folder contains a tycoon map created as a personal project, where I single-handedly developed the map including all programming, level design, gameplay logic and also imported various assets from Fab to enhance the visual quality and player experience.
  Files created/developed : all .verse files

- Training 2v2 Folder includes a 2v2 Box Fight map where I worked as a Lead Developer. I built the complete round system in Verse, designed and implemented all player UI features, and created an engaging quest system. I also led QA efforts, reviewed teammatesâ€™ code, suggested optimizations, and ensured smooth feature integration.
  Files created/developed: questmanager_verse, pregamelobby.verse, roundstart_manager.verse, round_zone, team_matchmaking.verse, joininprogress_manager.verse, display_matchresults.verse and all UIScripts

- Star Pillars folder includes a Pillars map where I developed the main core logic of the game and implemented systems such as bounty hunting, hat store, lobby management, mystery box handling, arena control, time-played rewards, accolade tracking, pillar management, and all associated UI scripts.
  Files created/developed: bounty_hunting.verse, hat_store.verse, lobby_controller.verse, mysterybox_handler.verse, pillars_arena.verse,
